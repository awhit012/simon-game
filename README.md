## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://ajibs.github.io/simon-game/

To create this, you will need to use variables, arrays, functions, event listeners, DOM interaction, if statements, and more! 

**Remember** to practice good Git habits! Commit *at least* every time you have completed one of the bullet points below.

**Hint:** Don't worry about using OOP, unless you really want to!

## User Stories:

* I am presented with a random button press, which I will then copy.

* Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

* If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

**BONUS**

* I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

* I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

* If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

* I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
